Bugfixes
=============

Query Interface:
    / ATTR_SELECT_ALL was defined as an integer but should be defined as "*"

Query Object:
    / SQL_select() failed to insert a space between the ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses
    / Fixed issue where Query::$placeholders would consistently add to itself if getSQL() was called more than once.
